## Classroom Project 10 by Sheryians Coding School

It’s a dynamic web app where random notifications appear automatically with sound effects. Each card can be deleted, marked as read/unread, muted/unmuted, and there's a theme switcher with 4 color option (saved using localStorage so your theme stays even after closing the browser!). It also features a live inbox status bar showing the total, unread, and new notifications — all updated in real-time!
